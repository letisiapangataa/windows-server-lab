# Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

## Event Log Monitoring
- Monitor critical logs (Security, System, Application).
- Alert on failed logins, privilege changes, and service failures.

## Email Notifications
- Configure PowerShell scripts and Task Scheduler for automated alerts.

## Integration
- Integrate with SIEM or third-party monitoring if available.
