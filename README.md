# Windows Server Lab Environment

A Windows Server 2022 lab simulating enterprise-grade Active Directory infrastructure with secure administration and automation.

---

## Project Overview

This lab environment demonstrates best practices in:

- Windows Server 2022 setup and domain configuration
- Active Directory (AD DS) management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Group Policy Object (GPO) automation
- PowerShell-based scripting
- Monitoring and alerting integration
- Disaster recovery simulation

---

## Key Features

- **Automated User Provisioning**: PowerShell scripts to bulk-create users and assign them to OUs and security groups.
- **RBAC Implementation**: Least-privilege model applied using Active Directory groups and delegated permissions.
- **Group Policy Automation**: Scripts to apply security baselines, login restrictions, and software controls.
- **Monitoring Setup**: Event log alerting and email notifications using PowerShell and Task Scheduler.
- **Disaster Recovery Simulation**: Documented restore procedures for AD services and system state backups.
