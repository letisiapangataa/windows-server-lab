# Architecture Diagram Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the lab architecture diagram.

To create the actual diagram, you can use tools like:

## Recommended Diagramming Tools:
- **Microsoft Visio** - Professional network diagrams
- **Draw.io** (now diagrams.net) - Free online diagramming
- **Lucidchart** - Cloud-based diagramming
- **yEd** - Free desktop graph editing software

## Diagram Should Include:
1. **Network Layout**
   - Domain Controller (DC01)
   - Client Workstations
   - Network segments and VLANs
   - IP address ranges

2. **Active Directory Structure**
   - Domain forest layout
   - Organizational Unit hierarchy
   - Trust relationships
   - Site topology

3. **Security Zones**
   - Management network
   - User networks
   - DMZ (if applicable)
   - Firewall placement

4. **Data Flow**
   - Authentication flows
   - Replication traffic
   - Backup processes
   - Monitoring connections

## Sample ASCII Diagram:
```
    Internet
        |
   [Firewall/Router]
        |
   [Core Switch] ---- [Management Network]
        |                      |
   [User Switch]         [DC01 - Domain Controller]
        |                      |
   [Workstations]        [Monitoring/Backup]
```

Replace this file with your actual network diagram showing the complete lab topology.
